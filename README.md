# Jandroid

Jandroid is a smite bot meant to assist players, specifically new players, in finding builds and item popularity for gods. New players often have trouble knowing what to build and they can sometimes struggle to find resources to assist them.

This bot is meant as a resource to account for that very issue. It has been implemented in the r/smite server recently and has had great usage and good success. The bot currently uses webscraping to get popular builds and items from smite.guru, however in the future I hope to be able to use the smite api and pull info from there.

Future plans for this bot include but are not limited to: 
- a $item command that displays the details and stats of items
- a command that takes in several arguments and does damage calcs based on builds and characters received
- many more ideas to come!

This bot was made by Frog, aka Frog#9951 on discord. If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas regarding Jandroid, please don't hesitate to reach out.
